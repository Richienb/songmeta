# Song Meta

An open source collection of music meta files.

## Usage

The `songs` folder holds subfolders for all subtitled songs.

In the folder, there is a `png` or `jpg` as album art, an `audio.mp3` file representing the actual song and `subtitles.srt` which are the actual subtitles.

## Contributing

Your contributions are greatly appreciated. Here's the general rule of thumb to do this:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Create a new branch for the song.
3. In the `songs` folder, create a subfolder with it's name set to the song name in title case.
4. In that folder, add the audio and rename it to `audio.mp3`.
5. Also, add the album art and rename it to `image.png` or `image.jpg` depending on the type (`png` preferred).
6. Add the SubRip subtitle file and rename it to `subtitles.srt`.
7. Create a pull request from your fork for this repository.

Thank you!
