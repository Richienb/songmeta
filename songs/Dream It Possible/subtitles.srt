1
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,980
I will run I will climb I will soar

2
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,100
I'm undefeated

3
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,500
Jumping out of my skin pull the chord

4
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,000
Yeah I believe it

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:30,400
The past is everything we were don't make us who we are

6
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:38,480
So I'll dream until I make it real and all I see is stars

7
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,380
It's not until you fall that you fly

8
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:47,040
When your dreams come alive you're unstoppable

9
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,960
Take a shot chase the sun find the beautiful

10
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:55,280
We will glow in the dark turning dust to gold

11
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,780
And we'll dream it possible

12
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,320
Possible

13
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:16,380
We'll dream it possible

14
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:20,720
I will chase I will reach I will fly

15
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,460
Until I'm breaking until I'm breaking

16
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:28,180
Out of my cage like a bird in the night

17
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,920
I know I'm changing I know I'm changing

18
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:38,300
In into something big better than before

19
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,680
And if it takes takes a thousand lives

20
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,940
Then it's worth fighting for

21
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:51,500

Never quit and never stop
