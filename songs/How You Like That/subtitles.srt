00:00:06,972 --> 00:00:09,183
BLACKPINK in your area

2
00:00:12,257 --> 00:00:15,885
보란 듯이 무너졌어

3
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:19,579
바닥을 뚫고 저 지하까지

4
00:00:19,604 --> 00:00:23,217
옷 끝자락 잡겠다고

5
00:00:23,242 --> 00:00:27,298
저 높이 두 손을 뻗어봐도

6
00:00:27,354 --> 00:00:31,086
다시 캄캄한 이곳에 light up the sky

7
00:00:31,141 --> 00:00:34,891
네 두 눈을 보며 I'll kiss you bye

8
00:00:35,003 --> 00:00:38,206
실컷 비웃어라 꼴좋으니까

9
00:00:38,231 --> 00:00:40,806
이제 너희 하나 둘 셋

10
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,139
Ha, how you like that?

Your girl need it all and that′s a hundred

23
00:01:14,013 --> 00:01:15,482
백 개 중에 백 내 몫을 원해

24
00:01:15,528 --> 00:01:16,547
Karma come and get some

25
00:01:16,559 --> 00:01:18,848
딱하지만 어쩔 수 없잖아

26
00:01:18,892 --> 00:01:20,631
What's up? I’m right back

27
00:01:20,637 --> 00:01:22,566
방아쇠를 cock back

28
00:01:22,602 --> 00:01:23,551
Plain Jane get hijacked

29
00:01:23,609 --> 00:01:26,598
Don′t like me? Then tell me how you like that, like that

30
00:01:26,654 --> 00:01:30,383
더 캄캄한 이곳에 shine like the stars

31
00:01:30,433 --> 00:01:34,302
그 미소를 띠며 I'll kiss you goodbye

32
00:01:34,356 --> 00:01:37,425
실컷 비웃어라 꼴좋으니까

33
00:01:37,477 --> 00:01:39,776
이제 너희 하나 둘 셋

34
00:01:40,232 --> 00:01:42,091

00:01:48,202 --> 00:01:49,461
How you like that?

How you like that

46
00:02:11,555 --> 00:02:15,224
날개 잃은 채로 추락했던 날

47
00:02:15,361 --> 00:02:19,010
어두운 나날 속에 갇혀 있던 날

48
00:02:19,062 --> 00:02:22,291
그때쯤에 넌 날 끝내야 했어

49
00:02:22,341 --> 00:02:25,838
Look up in the sky it's a bird it's a plane

50
00:02:39,874 --> 00:02:40,566
